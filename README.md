## Minimum Rust version policy

`parcom` is guaranteed to compile with the latest stable release of Rust in addition to the two
prior minor releases. For example, if the latest stable Rust release is 1.70, then `parcom` is
guaranteed to compile with Rust 1.68, 1.69, and 1.70.

The minimum supported Rust version may be increased to one of the aforementioned versions if doing
so provides the end user a benefit. However, the minimum supported Rust version may also be bumped
to a version four minor releases prior to the most recent stable release if doing so improves code
quality or maintainability.

Contributions are always welcome! If you have an idea, it's best to float it by me before working on
